#  Data Gathering in Python

This project focuses on practicing **data collection techniques**, which form the foundation of any data science workflow.  
The notebook demonstrates how to gather data from different sources such as JSON files and public APIs, and convert them into structured tabular formats for analysis.

##  About the Project

In this notebook, I explored multiple approaches to collect and prepare raw data using Python, including:

- Working with flat JSON files  
- Handling nested JSON structures  
- Normalizing JSON into tabular format using pandas  
- Fetching real-time data from an external API (CoinGecko)  
- Converting API responses into pandas DataFrames  

The goal is to understand how data is gathered before performing cleaning, EDA, or modeling.

##  Learning Outcome

Through this project, I practiced:
- Collecting data from multiple sources  
- Converting unstructured data into structured formats  
- Preparing raw data for downstream analysis and modeling  

This notebook strengthens my understanding of the **data ingestion stage** in real-world data science pipelines.
